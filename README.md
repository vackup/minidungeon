### What is this repository for? ###

The other day I was discussing with a friend about automatic dungeon creation in Unity3D and I recommend him an excelent and also a free and easy Unity project I had found some time ago. The project is called "MiniDungeon â€“ A Free Random Dungeon Jump Start for Unity" and it used to be hosted here http://www.stevegargolinski.com/minidungeon-a-free-random-dungeon-jump-start-for-unity/
For my and his suprise, the website was (actually is) down but I told him to not to worry because I have the source home at home.
As I think this code is great, I decided to re post the original blog spot (I have it in my pocket ;) and to upload the original source code to my public bitbucket.
